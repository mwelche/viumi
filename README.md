VIUMI
=====

*This is a jQuery plugin for detecting when an element is in the viewport.*

Check out the website for more info.

Basic Usage
-----------

There are two parts to making this work. The first part is the element you want to detect. The second part is picking what happens when that element is detected.

`$(yourElement).viumi();`

jQuery is required. (that pretty much goes without saying)


More options coming soon!
